* What is Relish?
Relish is a Java library that is designed to reduce the amount of code needed to create UI/acceptance tests. Although it doesn't require it, Relish is intended to be used with a BDD tool like Cucumber to automate a user-interface.

There are currently two flavours of Relish:

* =relish-selenide= For testing web applications.
  This requires the libraries `relish-core-....jar` and `relish-selenide-....jar`.
* =relish-espresso= For testing Android applications.
  This requires the libraries `relish-core-....jar` and `relish-espresso-....aar`.

You can find the latest version of these libraries on the [releases page](https://github.com/davidgriffithsbp/relish/releases).

* Getting the libraries for Maven/gradle:

The libraries can be downloaded through http://jitpack.io, so, for example, this is how you might get them in gradle:

#+BEGIN_SRC groovy
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    ....
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }

  dependencies {
    ....
    testCompile 'com.github.davidgriffithsbp:relish:0.0.119' # For version 0.0.119
  }
#+END_SRC
