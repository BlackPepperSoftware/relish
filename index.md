# What is Relish?

Relish is a Java library that is designed to reduce the amount of code needed to create UI/acceptance tests. Although it doesn't require it, Relish is intended to be used with a BDD tool like Cucumber to automate a user-interface.

There are currently two flavours of Relish:

-   `relish-selenide` For testing web applications
-   `relish-espresso` For testing Android applications
