<h1 style="margin-top: -16px">What is Relish?</h1>

Relish is a Java library that is designed to reduce the amount of code needed to create UI/acceptance tests. Although it doesn't require it, Relish is intended to be used with a BDD tool like Cucumber to automate a user-interface.

There are currently two flavours of Relish:

-   `relish-selenide` For testing web applications. This requires the libraries `relish-core-....jar` and `relish-selenide-....jar`.
-   `relish-espresso` For testing Android applications. This requires the libraries `relish-core-....jar` and `relish-espresso-....aar`.

You can find the latest version of these libraries on the [releases page](https://github.com/dogriffiths/relish/releases).
